Bug fixes:

* pestat -G now prints correctly the GRES used by each JobID on the node, in addition to the node's GRES.

* pestat -j joblist now works correctly for multiple jobs in joblist.

Changes under the hood:  Information from squeue and sinfo now uses the -O output flag for better readability of the code than with the old -o flag and its single-letter options.

Date: 14 July 2019
------------------

Flag multi-node jobs running on nodes in state==mixed (possibly incorrect node utilization)
Fix: Add "*" to nodename in default partition

version 0.61. Date: 07 July 2017
--------------------------------

New features:

Add option -g groupname: Print only users in group <groupname>

version 0.60. Date: 30 June 2017
--------------------------------

New features:

Add option -1 to show unique hostnames:
Only 1 line is printed even if a node is in several partitions.

Add option -j <joblist>

Add configurable thresholds for flagging nodes:
export cpuload_delta1=2.0       # CPU load delta from ideal load (RED)
export cpuload_delta2=0.5       # CPU load delta from ideal load (MAGENTA)
export memory_thres1=0.1        # Fraction of memory which is free (RED)
export memory_thres2=0.2        # Fraction of memory which is free (MAGENTA)

Introduced a sample pestat.conf configuration file:
# Global configuration file for pestat
export PESTAT_GLOBAL_CONFIG=/etc/pestat.conf
# Per-user configuration file for pestat
export PESTAT_CONFIG=$HOME/.pestat.conf

Thanks to Vicker, Darby (JSC-EG311) <darby.vicker-1@nasa.gov>
for suggesting and implementing these features.

Fixes:

Broken nodes should be printed in RED color.  This didn't work for the default partition
where the state is marked with "*" (like drain*), so now we strip the "*".

version 0.52. Date: 28 June 2017
--------------------------------

New features:

1. The width of the hostname column can now be changed in the CONFIGURE section:
export hostnamelength="8"
Thanks to Markus Koeberl <markus.koeberl@tugraz.at> for suggesting this feature. 
version 0.51. Date: 28 June 2017
--------------------------------

New features:

1. Turning on colors explicitly even when the output doesn't go to a terminal
with the -C flag (and -c to turn off colors).
Thanks to Fermin Molina <fmolina@nlhpc.cl> for requesting this!
Fermin suggests to allow a nice continuous monitoring of "flagged" nodes with:

# watch -n 60 --color 'pestat -f -C'

2. Added -n/-w hostlist to select a subset of nodes. 
The -n form is for compatibility with sinfo,
whereas -w is compatible with pdsh and clush (ClusterShell). 

version 0.50. Date: 22 June 2017
--------------------------------

I discovered how to obtain the node Free Memory with sinfo, so now we can do nice things with memory usage!

New features:

1. The "pestat -f" will flag nodes with less than 20% free memory.

2. Now "pestat -m 1000" will print nodes with less than 1000 MB free memory.

3. Use "pestat -M 200000" to print nodes with greater than 200000 MB free memory.  Jobs on such under-utilized nodes might better be submitted to lower-memory nodes. 

version 0.41. Date: 15 June 2017
--------------------------------

Colored output is now printed also when all nodes are listed, and the logic has been cleaned up a bit. 

version 0.40. Date: 09 May 2017
-------------------------------

Changed awk method for reading environment variables:
 	prefix=ENVIRON["prefix"]
Thanks to Daniel Letai for recommending better script coding styles.

version 0.35. Date: 04 May 2017
-------------------------------

Minor edits.  Added command prefix directory.

version 0.32. Date: 03 May 2017
-------------------------------

Added -s statelist: Print only nodes with state in <statelist>

version 0.30.  Date: 02 May 2017
--------------------------------

Added flagging of nodes and color output

Version 0.20. Date: 30 April 2017
---------------------------------

Added options [-u username] [-q qoslist]

Version 0.11. Date: 30 April 2017
---------------------------------

Hostlist formatting changed to "scontrol show hostnames NodeList"

Initial version 0.1, date: 30 April 2017
----------------------------------------

Prints a Slurm cluster status with 1 line per node/partition and job info.
